If you get SQL errors it should be because its made to work with databases that accept ADD IF NOT EXISTS.  
To create the tables on your database follow the steps:  

1. Remove every IF NOT EXISTS from server.lua  
2. Run the server once.  
3. Comment out the MySQL.query("vRP/dmv_column") adding -- before it  
4. Restart the server one more time.  
5. You're good to go from now on.
